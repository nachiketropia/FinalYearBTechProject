SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a widely-used notation that encodes chemical structures into short, linear strings of characters. This representation allows for the easy storage, transmission, and manipulation of molecular information in computational applications.

This application allows you to generate novel molecular SMILES structures using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model trained on the QM9 dataset. You can also predict molecular properties using Graph Neural Network (GNN) models (GCN and GIN).
